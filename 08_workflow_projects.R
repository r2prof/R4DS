# Create an RStudio project for each data analysis project.
# 
# Keep data files there; weâ€™ll talk about loading them into R in data import.
# 
# Keep scripts there; edit them, run them in bits or as a whole.
# 
# Save your outputs (plots and cleaned data) there.
# 
# Only ever use relative paths, not absolute paths.
